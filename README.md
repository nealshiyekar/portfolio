## Projects


### Kalasalingam Speech Recgnition

Led team at UTD and worked concurrently with Kalasalingam Academy to build a speech module in Python that allows people to operate computer application via voice commands. This application will help Amar Seva Sangam, a nonprofit in India that helps those with spinal cord injuries. This application allows user to operate TextEdit and NotePad. We utilized the Vosk Giga Speech model, which offered satisfactory response times and accurate transcriptions. Presented our work to peers and guests from companies in the DFW area.

Skills: Python, International Collaboration, Project Management, Workflow Design

### Wingmates - TamuHack Winner

The goal of the project is to give international fliers a little bit more comfort as they navigate airports that host a wide range of cultural identities. We proposed a social platform that allows passengers to connect with other fliers who share similar cultural backgrounds, as well as to view general flight information.
I worked on the matchiing algorithm which draws principles from ML and NLP and also helped with building the UI with React Native.

## Class Projects

### Financial Analysis

Developed objective strategy for discovering optimal EEG bands based on signal power spectra using **Python**. This data-driven approach led to better characterization of the underlying power spectrum by identifying bands that outperformed the more commonly used band boundaries by a factor of two. The proposed method provides a fully automated and flexible approach to capturing key signal components and possibly discovering new indices of brain activity.
